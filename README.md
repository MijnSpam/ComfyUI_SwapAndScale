Add node to workflow and connect a widht and heigth to the field. 

In ComfyUI:

1. example explanation:
    - `1`: Swap Width_Height is on and as you see the out_height is swapped with the width.
    - `2`: example input image had dimensions 1344x752 >> 752 /32 = 23.5 and so with the factor_32px it's resize to 736.
    - `3`: Total pixels (W*H) is below 1024000 px so no scaling done

2. example explanation:
    - `1`: NO Swap Width_Height, however 1MP and factor32 is on. <br>
    Width 1504 / 32 = 47, Height 2720 / 32 = 85 >> ratio (w/h 0.552) scaled ratio 736 / 1344 = 0.547<br>
     _Not perfect but it respects the 1MP Limit with the 32px rule._
